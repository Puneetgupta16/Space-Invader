1.  When working on a game create a main loop that will take care of all the important stuff like,
    handling collisions, calls for things to be drawn on the screen, when to quit the game, etc.
    NOTE:- Main loop will be in the main function

2.  pygame.QUIT is the method that will check if the user closes the window.

3. PYGAME COORDINATE SYSTEM:
        in pygame 0,0 is actually at the top left corner of the window.
        The same goes for drawing the objects
        
4. To Draw Text on the screen :
	First thing is to draw a font. We create a font object and then use that font object to actually render the text on the screen.
	We will turn the text into a surface and then draw that onto the screen.

5. Character:
	We have ships that will be moving on the screen for the characters. So we can create an abstract class(Class from which we are gonna inherit some properties
	for all the ships).

6. MOVEMENT:
	To Move the object on the screen we can use the event method from the pygame library but the issue with that is it only registers one key at a time.
	If we press multiple keys, say up and left keys, it won't work!
	We are using the "pygame.key.get_pressed()" method. What it does is it returns a dictionary of how many keys are pressed at the time.
	
7. MASK:
	Mask will enable us to make pixel perfect collision: mask tells where a pixel is in the image.

8. Enemy Ship movement:
	What we are gonna do is to spawn all the enemy ships at once. But to create an effect that they are commig in diffferent time we will spawn them
	above the player screen at random height(random negetive y values).
